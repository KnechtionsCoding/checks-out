approvals:
# This is the array of approval policies.
#
# For each pull request we traverse the array
# of approval policies until we find the first policy
# that matches. Note that the approval policy is
# an ordered list. You should specify your most specific
# policies first and your least specific policies last.
#
# An approval policy will match based
# on the criteria in the "scope" section. You can
# match based on the pull request base branch or
# based on the file paths of the modified files.
#
# The most common configuration will have only
# a single approval policy. The last approval policy
# is required to have an empty "scope" section.
# The last policy is the default approval policy. This
# policy will be applied when none of the other policies
# have matched.
